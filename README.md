## College Board / Teacher Requirements (Track to Meeting Them)

| Big Idea Number / Requirement           | Big Idea Summary  | Project Goal To Meet Each Requirement |
| -------------------------- |---------------------| ----------------------------------|
| Big Idea #1                | Technical Requirements | Backend Code: Flask framework that takes information from both python database files with dictionaries, and sql databases with tables. Utilize libraries, pass variables to html files, and integrate with databases. Have routes for the templates and the main pages (login, homepage, dashboard, form sites).    Database requirements/SQLAlchemy: Use SQLAlchemy to store user information (usernames, passwords, user information). Tables that store the posting information, which will have connections to the user information. Emoji table, which stores the emojis and feelings of the user.|| Big Idea #1                | Technical Requirements | Database requirements/SQLAlchemy: Use SQLAlchemy to store user information (usernames, passwords, user information).

| Big Idea #1                | Technical Requirements | Data-drive UI: User dashboards will be created using data from the user tables. We will create one html page with the template, and use SQL Queries and data-drive UI to create the various unique posts.|
| Big Idea #1                | Technical Requirements | Filtering, searching, and analysing large quantities of data: Will analyze the user information to determine the number of users on the site. Create a search function that searches all trending messages and users on the site. Will search users when creating accounts, and search users when friending other users and sharing your emojis and messages among friends. We’ll also analyze information in the emotions/feelings section as well as messages posted onto the web. We will then create a #trending page so users can see what is trending at the moment.|
| Big Idea #2                | UI Design & Presentation| UI Implementation: We’ll use a styles.css and javascript.js file to implement our styles and animations. Transform and transitions will be used to create animations. Templates will be used to generate the user and playlist pages. We will use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to implement our design.|
| Big Idea #3                | Deployment              | Raspberry Pi Deployment & Internet Routing: The website will be deployed on Eva or Risa’s Raspberry Pi. Port forwarding is already set up. All users will be able to access the website via the Raspberry Pi’s public IP address.|
| Big Idea #3                | Deployment              | Usage of HTTP GET and POST methods: HTTP GET Methods will be used to obtain static web pages such as the homepage, while POST methods will be used to obtain dynamically generated web pages. POST methods will be used on the: Login page and sign up page, Personal user page/pages for other users, Edit user information site, Search.|
