## College Board / Teacher Requirements (Track to Meeting Them)

| Big Idea Number / Requirement           | Big Idea Summary  | Project Goal To Meet Each Requirement |
| -------------------------- |---------------------| ----------------------------------|
| Big Idea #1                | Technical Requirements | Backend Code: Flask framework that takes information from both python database files with dictionaries, and sql databases with tables. Utilize libraries, pass variables to html files, and integrate with databases. Have routes for the templates and the main pages (login, homepage, dashboard, form sites).    Database requirements/SQLAlchemy: Use SQLAlchemy to store user information (usernames, passwords, user information). Tables that store the posting information, which will have connections to the user information. Emoji table, which stores the emojis and feelings of the user.|
